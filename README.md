# I need to introduce myself ?

~~I'm me !~~ I'm @Remingusu. I live in the **earth**. I'm the same age as *someone* else in the world. If you want to meet me, found me or just see my [blog](https://blogs.mtdv.me/blog/posts/user_personal_data_copyt)

My favourite game is [the game everyone has to play](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com). I play also at [Star Rail](https://hsr.hoyoverse.com). I wait for [Project Mugen](https://www.projectmugen.com).

More seriously (or not...)

  1. My IDE is the best, it's the [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) panoply 😎 [![idea](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=idea)](https://skillicons.dev)

I know my profile is unbelievable, but quit **NOW** and go install *[the game everyone has to play](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com)*
